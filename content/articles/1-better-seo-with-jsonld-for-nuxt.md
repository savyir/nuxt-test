_“Search engine marketing and search engine optimization are critically important to online businesses. You can spend every penny you have on a website, but it will all be for nothing if nobody knows your site is there.” — Marc Ostrofsky_

### beginning of a new web site
starting a new web site and providing new content can seem like a daunting task. few things are tougher than the prospect of starting from ground zero. moreover, depending on what type of content you need, it might seem difficult to align yourself into the slipstream of the traffic flow.

### get used to it
when tackling a new website, developers often have the urge to take it all down at end. However, as the saying goes , "the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time." like anything else, improving the SEO of a website takes time. more than anything though, it helps to start small and work your way up. 

so while your ultimate goal may be to stand in google rank #1 , try to work on main and essential pages first.
